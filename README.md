## üéØ Problem & Our Solution

### ‚ùì The Challenge

- **Problem Statement:** Business meetings produce vast amounts of unstructured data. Manual transcription, summarization, and tracking decisions is both time-consuming and error-prone.
- **Why It Matters:** Capturing key insights and actionable items quickly can dramatically improve productivity and ensure nothing important is overlooked.

### üí° Our Innovative Approach

- **Solution:** Leverage AI to automate transcript management and generate concise meeting summaries along with extracted key decisions and action items.
- **How It Works:** Users can upload or generate meeting transcripts. Audio files are transcribed using IBM Watson, and then the transcript is processed using Agno/IBM Granite to produce summaries and extract actionable insights. Optionally, notifications are sent via Slack to keep stakeholders informed.
